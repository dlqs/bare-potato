#+TITLE: FRRouting simple eBGP setup

Set up for two routers: r1 in AS 100, r2 in AS 200.
r1 will broadcast its static routes to r2.
We're using Lua match script for route-map.

In r1:
#+begin_src
hostname r1
!
interface veth0
 ip address 10.0.0.100/31
!
router bgp 1
 bgp router-id 10.0.1.100
 no bgp ebgp-requires-policy
 neighbor 10.0.0.101 remote-as external
 !
 address-family ipv4 unicast
  redistribute static
 end-address-family
!
line vty
!
#+end_src

In r2:
#+begin_src
hostname r2
!
interface veth1
 ip address 10.0.0.101/31
!
router bgp 2
 bgp router-id 10.0.1.101
 no bgp ebgp-requires-policy
 neighbor 10.0.0.100 remote-as external
 !
 address-family ipv4 unicast
  neighbor 10.0.0.100 route-map RMAP in
 end-address-family
!
route-map RMAP permit 10
 match script routemap
!
line vty
!
#+end_src

In r1, add a static route
#+begin_src
ip route 1.1.1.1/32 veth0
#+end_src

In r2, check that it receives it:
#+begin_src
show bgp summary
#+end_src

For r1, any prefix whose gateway is veth0 should work, besides those already reachable from r2 (since those will be preferred instead)

journalctl -f -u frr should show the zlog prints
