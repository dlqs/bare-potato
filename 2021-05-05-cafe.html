<p>
I go to cafes often and want to record down my experience, so that I can leave a trail of credible, organic reviews for these places.
So that reviews for these places aren't just dominated by professional bloggers' sites which are SEO-ed to death.
</p>

<p>
I rate these cafes commensurate with their prices. I don't expect single-origin coffee from the neighborhood
<i>kopi-tiam</i>, but I also believe that Starbucks coffee is way overpriced. Of course, the coffee merely forms part of the cafe experience among other factors,
such as the atmosphere and the food, so I try to keep those in mind too.
</p>

<p>
My scale is out of 5:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>3 is at expectation,</li>
<li>2 and 4 are below and above respectively, and</li>
<li>1 and 5 are way below and way above respectively.</li>
</ul>

<li>Visited in May 2021. Tried the Ethopian pour over. It's alright; nice clean taste, but not much else.</li>
<li>The cafe has a nice aesthetic, except that the outward view is kinda terrible due to ongoing construction outside.</li>
<li>3/5, since it was priced relatively higher at $8.</li>

<li>Visited in May 2021. I spotted Nylon beans, but I'm not sure which ones they used specifically.</li>
<li>Nice ambience, but CHIMES is just nice in general.</li>

<li>3/5</li>
