Thai Basil Chicken (Pad Krapow Gai) ratings from 1-5. I usually choose chicken, but sometimes I eat pork/beef too.

Note: I've never had an "authentic" one in Thailand before.

* Nana Original Thai
  * Clementi, right outside of NUS
  * Spiciness: 3/5
  * Taste: 3/5. What I order by default. Somewhat oily.
  * I've had this literally dozens of times, so it's what I grade everything else against.

* ThaiLily Novena Restaurant
  * Novena
  * Spiciness: 4/5
  * Taste: 5/5. Succulent.
  * Perfectly blonde fried egg (not a fan of the brown bits in Thai-style fried egg).
