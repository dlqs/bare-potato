#+TITLE: Rainbow text with Awk
#+HTML_HEAD: <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles.css"/>

Want a particular line in your shell script to stand out? Use this sick, POSIX-compliant rainbow script!

#+attr_html: :width 400px
#+attr_latex: :width 200px
file:static/rainbow_scrot.png

To try, simply copy and paste this into your shell (it'll download and run the awk script)
#+begin_src shell
wget https://gist.githubusercontent.com/dlqs/cfaf6bec0dd8b32e2e4e83ab4e16ea54/raw/ec33825f53b92e4e11ec52bc07acc3a005fdddb7/rainbow.awk && \
    python3 -c 'print("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\n"*10, end="")' | awk -f rainbow.awk
#+end_src

I was inspired to do this when I wanted to add a shameless ask for GitHub stars for one of my projects, but didn't want to drag in an entire Ruby dependency.
Strictly speaking, its not a rainbow, but the colors look cool anyways.
