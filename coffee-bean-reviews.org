#+title: Coffee Bean Reviews

I don't have sensitive taste buds. You know how coffee beans usually list their tasting notes on the package? I can barely taste those. So these reviews are really just me.

I'm ranking these from 1-5.
And I'm always ranking them commensurate with their prices.

** Thus Coffee
Star Vista | 250g | $15 | espresso | May 2021
 - The barista went under the counter and poured out the beans from a giant bucket into a bag, then slapped a sticker on it.
 - So the low quality shouldn't be a surprise - beans stored like that can't possibly stay good for very long.
 - I gave this place a pity try since the other nearby cafes were all out of beans, just before the Circuit Breaker.
 - 2/5. Actually tastes ok, but $15 is pricey for beans of this quality.

** Jimmy Monkey
One-North | 250g | $16 | espresso | 2021
 - Oily, really oily crema. The beans shine. Pretty nutty, chocolatey. 
 - Side note: I've been buying beans from Jimmy Monkey since 2013, but they don't roast them there anymore.
 - 4/5. So far, best value for money.

** Paradise
Mr Brownstone

Beauty World | 250g | $18 | espresso | 2020
 - Meh, not very good.
 - I bought mine from Flag White at Beauty World but I've seen it sold in other cafes too.
 - 2/5. Not worth the price.

Uraga Tome

Jalan Besar | 250g | $18 | pour-over | 2020
 - Legitimately tasted ginger and orange. Not too overpowering, but just enough to identify it. Doesn't taste like any other pour-over I've ever had.
 - Really amazing aroma. Light ginger scent.
 - 5/5, but in general I prefer espressos.
